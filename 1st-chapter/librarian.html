        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <a href = "./letter.html">You take the letter and open it at the library desk to examine it.</a>
        <br><p>or</p>
        <a href = "./steal.html">you steal the letter to examine closer at home.</a>
        <br><p>or</p>
        <a href = "./destroy.html">you decide not to get yourself into trouble with weird letters in books and you destroy it by ripping it apart</a>
